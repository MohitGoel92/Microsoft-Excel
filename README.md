# Microsoft-Excel

This repository contains the necessary tools for learning Excel. This will take a complete Excel novice to a level of business proficiency in reporting and analytics.

Before we get started with the technicalities of Excel, let's begin with some basic facts.

- Since the 2007 release of Excel, the standard Excel file extension has been changed to .xlsx.
- An Excel workbook can contain upto 255 worksheets.
- The Quick Access Toolbar that is located at the top left corner of the application (the green bar) provides access to some of the basic Excel commands.
- We may select any function that we commonly use and pin it to the Quick Access Toolbar for quick utilisation anytime. We only need to simply right click on any command found on the ribbon and select "Add to Quick Access Toolbar".

## Working with Numerical Data

We are free to simply click on any cell and enter any numerical or alphabetical data (or a combination of both) into the cell.

If we produce a table with headings and numerical data, we notice that the numerical data is aligned to the right of the cell and the alphabetical headings are aligned to the left of the cell. This is the case with the majority of softwares and there are two reasons for this:

- This makes it clearer to differentiate the difference between the alphabetical and numerical data, avoiding confusion and therefore being practical.
- As the numerical data is aligned to the right, this makes all decimals perfectly aligned regardless of the differences in the number of decimal places. If the numbers were left aligned, we may see the decimal point fluctuate like a wave as we go down the column which is confusing to the eye and therefore prone to giving a false impression.

**Note:** If Excel shows a green triangle at the top left corner of the cell, that means Excel is unsure whether to classify the cell contents as a number or string. This can be resolved by clicking the triangle and setting it to numerical or string.
